First we need a directory with a setup.py and the folders to the package
the setup.py will have the mapping to the folders

Inside the package directory - the one with the __init__.py file, at the same level, we should have
a README.md and a license.txt (probably with MIT license as I always use)

all files, tests, classes should be organized inside this folder

with all code done and tests passing, you should go to the folder with the setup.py and run

python setup.py sdist # this will create the files and folders ready for upload
pip install twine # in case it is not installed

twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/* #this will upload the dist folder contents to the test pypi. There you can check installation. It asks for username and password
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ davis-distributions==1.0.0 # this will install the package you just uploaded... checking of everything is ok
pip uninstall davis-distributions # uninstall the test package...

twine upload dist/* # now to the real pypi repositories... it asks for username and password
pip install davis-distributions # test the real deal
